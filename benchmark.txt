"nearby" refers to finding points that are nearby, to check if we even need to apply any forces
"apply" refers to actually collecting all nearby points and applying a force.
So .001 for "nearby" means only sampling .1% of nearby points to see if we even need to apply forces. 
.1 for "apply" means 10% of points nearby were sampled and aggregated into a single force

5000 objects
300 search radius:

- When sampling .001 for nearby and .1 for apply":
	21-23 FPS

	- 21 FPS if objects check for nearby even when their netforce is 0

- When .1 for apply, no nearby:
	13 FPS
	
- When ALL for apply, .001 for nearby:
	5 FPS

- When ALL EDGES for apply, .001 for nearby:
	24-25 FPS

- When sampling ALL EDGES for nearby, .1 for apply:
	13 FPS
